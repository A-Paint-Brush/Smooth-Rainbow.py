# Smooth-Rainbow.py

This is the Python implementation of the repository [Smooth Rainbow](https://github.com/A-Paint-Brush/Smooth-Rainbow).

## Instructions

To run the script, do a `pip3 install pygame` if you don't have `Pygame` installed, then run `main.py`. The displayed window can be resized freely, and it will switch between windowed and full-screen mode when F11 is pressed.
